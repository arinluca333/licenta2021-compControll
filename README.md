# licenta2021-compControll
Project for my bachelor's degree.
It is a project used to controll a PC using only a webcam and a microphone. It can count the number of fingers that you are holding up and do an action as you configure it. It will move the cursor with your hand movements and it can listen to words that you configure.
It contains three apps:
A configuration app called ConfModule.exe where you can configure it.
A java word recognition app made using the Voce library. It is started by the third app.
An openCV app that controls the image input and also starts the java app. It is called Licenta_1.0.exe.
