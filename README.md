Project for my bachelor's degree.
It is a project used to controll a PC using only a webcam and a microphone. It cas count the number of fingers that you are holding up and do an action as you configure it. It will move the
cursor whit your hand movements and it can listen to words that you configure.
It contains three apps:
A configuration app called ConfigModule.exe where you can configure it.
A java word recognition app made using the Voce library.
An openCV app that controls the image input and also starts the java app. It is called Licenta_1.0.exe
